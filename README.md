TOP Rock Paper Scissors Project

Basic Rock Paper Scissors game using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 
First basic JS project. Meant to (at first) simply run the game completely on the console. Project updated with interactive buttons added through CSS and HTML.

Rock-paper-scissors game where the user plays against the computer. Concepts utilized include DOM manipulation, randomization using predefined Math functions, conditional statements, and functions. 

The game was intially created with HTML and Javascript, focusing on the logic of gathering information from the user through the console and comparing it to the information generated by the computer. It was later update to run interactively on the webpage rather than the console.
